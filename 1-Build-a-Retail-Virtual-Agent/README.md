# Building Advanced Chatbots and Voice bots using Dialogflow CX
**Introduction to Dialogflow CX:** 
Dialogflow CX is designed for building complex conversational agents, suitable for scenarios like customer service in call centers, where the chatbot needs to handle multiple queries and maintain context over long conversations.

**Comparison with Dialogflow ES**:
While Dialogflow ES (Essentials) is capable of handling simpler interactions primarily focused on intent matching and entity extraction, CX is built to manage more intricate conversational flows without requiring extensive coding.
